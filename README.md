# EZPanel (coming soon)

Do you have a Minecraft server? You complain about your hosting provider's panel or you have a VPS or dedicated server and would like to have a convenient console? EZPanel is a lifesaver for you! Type one simple command to open your server's convenient console in your browser!

The plugin is based on [bytesocks](https://github.com/lucko/bytesocks) - a great way to communicate between the site and your Minecraft server, known from [LuckPerms](https://github.com/LuckPerms/LuckPerms) or [spark](https://github.com/lucko/spark).

## Feature list / TODO
- Server console with typing commands as operator with status of used CPU and RAM
- Viewing and editing server files (only the directory and subdirectories where the server was started)
- Editing text files
- Sending new files
- Selfthost option (always running, authenticated, needs one opened port)
- Permissions system (e.g. only vieving console or files)
